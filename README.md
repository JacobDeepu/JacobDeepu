# Hi, I’m Jacob Deepu 👋

I’m a software engineer with 4+ years of experience working on backend systems in production. Most of my work has been in C#/.NET and PHP/Laravel, with a focus on keeping systems stable, improving database performance, and automating deployments.

I’ve worked across different codebases and stacks depending on the problem, and I’m comfortable stepping outside my main role when needed - including frontend and mobile work.

---

## What I work on

- Backend services and APIs (ASP.NET Core, Laravel)
- Database design and performance tuning (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
- CI/CD pipelines and deployments (Docker, GitHub Actions)
- Maintaining and improving existing production systems

---

## Experience highlights

- Designed and maintained backend systems for an Insurance CRM using ASP.NET Core and PostgreSQL  
- Worked on the Wonderla Ride Monitoring System, supporting real-time uptime tracking and KPI reporting using .NET Framework and Oracle  
- Improved ERP reporting performance by optimizing queries and indexes, reducing load times from minutes to milliseconds  
- Built Laravel-based web applications including admission management systems and event platforms  
- Stepped in to support a Flutter mobile app during resource gaps, fixing production issues and shipping features
